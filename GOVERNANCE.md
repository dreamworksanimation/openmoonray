# MoonRay Project Governance

There are three primary project roles: Contributors submit code to the project; Committers approve code to be included into the project; and the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) provides overall high-level project guidance.

* [Contributors](#Contributors)
* [Committers](#Committers)
* [Technical Steering Committee](#Technical-Steering-Committee)

## Contributors

The MoonRay project grows and thrives from assistance from Contributors. Contributors include anyone in the community who contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts that have been incorporated into the project repository.

Anyone can be a Contributor. You need no formal approval from the project, beyond the legal forms.

### How to Become a Contributor

* Review the coding standards and [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to ensure your contribution is in line with the project's coding and styling guidelines.

* Sign the Individual CLA, or if you are employed by an organization that might have any claim to IP you create, have your organization sign the Corporate CLA.

* Submit your code as a PR with the appropriate DCO sign-off on each commit. The easiest way to do this is to ensure that you commit your code with `git commit -s`.

## Committers

Project Committers have merge access on the MoonRay GitHub repositories and are responsible for approving submissions by Contributors.

### Committer Responsibilities

Typical activities of a Committer include:

* Helping users and novice contributors.

* Ensuring a response to questions posted to the various communication channels.

* Contributing code and documentation changes that improve the project.

* Reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests.

* Ensuring that changes and new code meet acceptable standards and are in the long-term interest of the project.

* Merging pull requests.

### How to Become a Committer

Any member of the MoonRay community (though typically an existing Committer or TSC member) may nominate an individual making significant and valuable contributions to the MoonRay project to become a new Committer.
To nominate a new Committer, open an issue in the MoonRay repository, send mail to the TSC mail list, or raise the issue at a TSC meeting. New Committers are accepted or rejected by majority vote of the TSC.

The TSC may periodically review the Committer list to identify inactive Committers. Past Committers are typically given Emeritus status. Emeriti may request that the TSC restore them to active Committer status.

## Technical Steering Committee

A subset of the Committers forms the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), which has final authority over the project. As defined in the project charter, TSC responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

* Coordinating technical direction of the project.
* Project governance and contribution policy.
* Maintaining the list of additional Committers.
* Maintenance and administration of the MoonRay GitHub repositories.
* Appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities.
* Discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the MoonRay project.
* Coordinating marketing, events, and communications regarding MoonRay.

The TSC elects a Chair person, who acts as the project manager, organizing meetings and providing oversight to project administration. The Chair is elected by the TSC. 


### TSC Members

Current voting members of the TSC are:

* **Chair**: Jon Lanz - DreamWorks Animation
* Jeff Mahovsky - DreamWorks Animation
* Matthew Low - DreamWorks Animation
* Paul Ramsey - DreamWorks Animation
* Randy Packer - DreamWorks Animation
* Rob Wilson - DreamWorks Animation
* Toshi Kato - DreamWorks Animation

### TSC Nomination and Succession

Any proposal for additional members of the TSC may be submitted by Committers,
TSC members, or other major stakeholders of the MoonRay community by
opening an issue outlining their case or raising the issue at a TSC meeting.
New TSC members are accepted or rejected by majority vote of the TSC.

If a TSC member is for an extended period not regularly participating or
performing the responsibilities expected of TSC members, the TSC may by
majority vote request an alternate TSC member be submitted by that
organization, or remove the inactive member from the TSC.

A voting member of the TSC may nominate a successor in the event that such
voting member decides to leave the TSC, and the TSC, including the departing
member, shall confirm or reject such nomination by a vote. In the event that
the departing member's nomination for successor is rejected by vote of the
TSC, the departing member shall be entitled to continue nominating successors
until one such successor is confirmed by vote of the TSC. If the departing
member fails or is unable to nominate a successor, the TSC may nominate one on
the departing member's behalf.

TSC membership is presumed to be retained by the individual even if they
change employers, provided they remain active in the project. The TSC may take
action to ensure that organizational stakeholder representation not become
severely disproportionate, for example by urging an organization that loses
its sole TSC representative to nominate a new member, or by limiting the total
number of voting members from any one organization if too many members all
move to the same organization.

### TSC Meetings

Any meetings of the TSC are intended to be open to the public, except where
there is a reasonable need for privacy. The TSC meets regularly in a video
conference call, at a cadence deemed appropriate by the TSC. The TSC Chair
moderates the meeting, or appoints another TSC member to moderate in his or
her absence.

Items are added to the TSC agenda which are considered contentious or are
modifications of governance, contribution policy, TSC membership, or release
process, in addition to topics involving the high-level technical direction
of the project.

The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches. That
should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger group of
Committers.

Any community member or Contributor can ask that something be reviewed by
the TSC at the meeting by logging a GitHub issue. Any Committer, TSC member,
or the meeting Chair can bring the issue to the TSC's attention by applying
the `TSC` label.

Prior to each TSC meeting, the meeting Chair will share the agenda with
members of the TSC. TSC members can also add items to the agenda at the
beginning of each meeting. The meeting Chair and the TSC cannot veto or
remove items.

The TSC may invite additional persons to participate in a non-voting
capacity.

The meeting Chair is responsible for ensuring that minutes are taken and
archived in the project repository or other designated accessible location.
